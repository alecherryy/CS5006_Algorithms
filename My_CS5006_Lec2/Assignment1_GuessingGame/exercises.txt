Assignment 1 - Alessia Pizzoccheri

In order to start thinking a bit algorithmically, modify this file and answer the following questions. Be sure to add/commit/push any changes made to this file to our repository.


1.) In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses could it take to get the right number if we had no hint at all? Explain.

10 possible guesses. Without hints, a player would check each possible number one
by one, starting with 1, 2, 3,... all the way to 10, for a grand total of 10
guesses. In broader terms, without hints it will take a player n guesses for an
array of possible choices of lenght n.  

2.) In the worst case in our guessing game--how many guesses does it take to get the right number if we get a hint of 'higher or lower' when guessing numbers 1-10? *Hint* In your answer you might show this mathematically with the log function.
Assuming, we guess 5 since it's half way between 1 and 10, in the worst case
scenario it will take us at least 4 guesses (max of 5). If we had 8 numbers to choose
from, the max number of guesses would be 3, since 8 is a power of 2. Since there
are 10 numbers, we'll make at least 4 guesses (log n).
